% While True: This Loop would work in an infinite manner if the plot of the
% output is not needed. The plot restricts it from being infinite because
% of two reasons:
% 1. The plot needs a defined x-value on which it will plot, therefore this
% needs to be a predefined constant value that cannot be exceeded.
% 2. The plot requires persistent dynammic programming for keeping all
% arrays values and displaying them. If no plot is needed, only 3 arrays 
% with constant sizes can be defined an memory overriding with a dynammic 
% programming approach could be used, making the system run in a seamless 
% infinite way.
